Calimero is a freely available software tool for auto calibration of simulation models in the field of urban drainage. The innovation of that tool is the flexibility to work with any model whichâ€™s input and output files are plain text and which can be started from command line and the possibility to consider a-priori knowledge on system behaviour. The algorithms for evaluating the objective function and the calibration algorithm itself are defined by the user in a scripting environment to provide best possible flexibility.
